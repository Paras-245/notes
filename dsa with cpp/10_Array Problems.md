2. [find unique](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/find-unique_625159): there are n = 2m +1 elements in array in which m elements are twice and 1 value is once , find the unique value.
- here we use the xor property bcs it will cancel out the similar elements

3. [Find duplicates](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problem-details/duplicate-in-array_893397): there are 1 to n -1 elements and from which one occuring twice
vector is dynamic array
- we first take xor of elements and then take xor with (1 to  n -1) then only duplicate will be left
