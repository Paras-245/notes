## Complexity:
- to identify which algorithm is better to use and which is fast.
## Time complexity :
- It is amount of time taken by an algorithm to run
- as a function of length of the input
- for making better programs and comparison of algo
- we cant compare algo with speed of machine

## Notations or Units of Time Complaxity :
1. Big O notation : upper bound or worst case
2. Theta : average case complexity
3. Omega : lower bound

## Times :
1. Constant Time -> O(1)
2. Linear Time -> O(n)
3. Logarithmic Time -> O(log n)
4. Quadritic Time -> O(n2)
5. Cubic Time -> O(n3)

## Solving Questions :
- ignore constants and lower degree

1. printing of array O(N)
2. reversing of array : O(N)
3. Linear Search: O(N)
4. Get Minimum from array:O(N)
5.
