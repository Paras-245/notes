- we can remeber this with cards example
- like if i give you cards one by one and you make them sorted
## What is Insertion Sort :
- it will take n-1 rounds
- take first element at index 0
- then check the next element 
- if the no is smaller then no then check for previous element if exist
- else does not change the element
- we will not swap in these but we will shift elements
