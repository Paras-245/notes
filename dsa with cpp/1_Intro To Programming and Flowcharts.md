## Flowcharts : 
Dynamic representation of an approach
### Components of Flowchart :
1. Terminator : (OVAL) start or end of the program
2. Input/Output : (PARALLELOGRAM)
3. Process : (RECTANGLE)
4. Decision : (RHOMBUS) It gives YES or NO
5. Flow : (ARROWS)
6. Connector : (CIRCLE) used for functions




## Pseudocode :
way of generic representing logic

## Examples :
1. print sum of two numbers
2. print simple interest
3. average of 3 numbers
4. check a < b
5. check number is odd or even
6. check number is positive,negative or zero
7. valid triangle or not
8. print 1 to n
9. print even numbers from 1 to n
10. find sum of 1 to n (inclusive)
11. find factorial of n
12. check given number prime or not

## Programming Languages :
1. way to communicate to computer which have some sementics and rules
2. compiler converts source code to binary so computer could understand
