- as we require to store matrix or make tic tac toe , we need arrays with rows and columns or 2d arrays
- to solve this we store the arrays as it is but use a formula c\*i+j to access the elements where c is total columns , i is rows and j is column
## Creation of 2d arrays :
- datatype name\[rows\]\[columns\]
### Input :
- in 1d we say : cin >> arr\[\]
cin >> arr\[row\]\[column\]
### Output :
cout <<
