- when we create a variable , we give it a name,but in the memory it is not identified by the name,it has a specific address,which is mapped by the symbol table(it is a data structure created by the compiler to keep track of variables,classes objects etc)
- there is *&* operator used to get the address of the variable 
- so pointer is used to deal with address of variables stuff
```cpp
int *ptr = &i;
```
- here the ptr variable hold the address of variable i
- here int tells the datatype our pointer pointing to
