## Bitwise Operator :
1. AND -> & : it gives 1 when both bits are 1
2. OR -> | : it gives 1 when atleast one bit is one
3. NOT -> ~ : it inverts the bit
4. XOR -> ^ : it gives 1 when both bits are different
5. LEFT SHIFT -> << : it majorly multiplies by power of 2
6. RIGHT SHIFT -> >> : in case of +ve num padding is done with 0 but in -ve padding is compiler dependent .it majorly divides by the power of 2.

## Increment & Decrement Operator :
1. Post Increment : i++ 
2. Pre Increment : ++i
3. Post Decrement : i--
4. Pre Decrement : --i

## For Loop :
Syntax:
```cpp
for(initialization;conditon or conditons;updation)
{
	statements;
}
```

- we also can use like for(;;;)
- we also can use mutiple initializations and multiple conditons in single for loop

## Break : 
it will make you exit from the current loop. or switch statement

## Continue :
it will skip the current iteration

## Programs : 
1. find sum of numbers from 1 to n.
2. print fibonacci series
3. check no is prime or not

## Variables & Scope :
we cant create two variables with same name in a same block
